Decentraleyes
=============

A [web browser extension](https://decentraleyes.org) that emulates Content Delivery Networks locally by intercepting requests, finding the required resource and injecting it into the environment. This all happens instantaneously, automatically, and no prior configuration is required. Feel free to use this [testing utility](https://decentraleyes.org/test) to see if it's properly installed, enabled, and correctly configured.

> **Note:** Decentraleyes is no silver bullet, but it does prevent a lot of websites from making you send these kinds of requests. Ultimately, you can make Decentraleyes block requests for any missing CDN resources, too.

## Custom Resources

You can set a folder path to a custom resource folder in Addon options menu. Place your versions of supported resources, complying with the scheme of bundled resources (without .dec extension). See resources.js paths for currently supported resources and file names.
Example: [YourFolder]/resources/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js

## Roadmap

Now that there's a solid, Mozilla approved, foundation, it's time to move forward. Mobility, extensibility (through support for community-powered resource packages), and usability, will be the main points of attention during this phase.

#### Essential Next Steps

* Start work on a resource bundle standard, to allow users to create and import custom resources. With support for these bundles in place, Decentraleyes will still work out of the box, but can be extended if needed.
* To keep this add-on from turning into bloatware, it's important to find out which versions of which libraries are most commonly used on websites, so that less popular resources can be removed from the default bundle.

#### Planned Features

* Advanced policy management for users who block requests for missing resources.
* Smarter resource version interpretation for handling dynamic notations.
* A minimalistic and non-essential graphical user interface.
* Support for custom, importable, library repositories.

> **Note:** These long-term goals are subjective to change, and can be discussed. That is, as long as the suggestions do not conflict with the ultimate goal of realizing a free and open standard for exchanging web resource bundles.
